> Developer's Note: This My third time making something that involves a chat interface, I've come a long way for sure. This is my most expensive projest so far, mainly because I have to pay for each and every token that goes in and out of the application. Non the less, working with Google's AI model was fun, and hopefully, next time I get to train my own AI model.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
