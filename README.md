> Developer's Note: I have a love and hate relationship with this project... I love the fact that this project is one of, if not my most complex project (arguably). It is so complex in size, functionality, features, like I actually felt the reason why there are more than one devs on a project. Features include: Login-Logout, Admin panel, in-built bankin system, record tracking system, user profile editting, purchasing system etc, there's so many. I hate this project because I simply don't like the UI, so many good functionalities and the UI weighs everything down, again I'm not a frontend developer, but i hope you enjoy the application itself.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
