> Developer's Note: I have a love and hate relationship with this project... I love the fact that this project is one of, if not my most complex project (arguably). It is so complex in size, functionality, features, like I actually felt the reason why there are more than one devs on a project. Features include: Login-Logout, Admin panel, in-built bankin system, record tracking system, user profile editting, purchasing system etc, there's so many. I hate this project because I simply don't like the UI, so many good functionalities and the UI weighs everything down, again I'm not a frontend developer, but i hope you enjoy the application itself.
